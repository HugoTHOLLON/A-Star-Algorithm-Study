# A\* Algorithm Study

The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the A* (A-star) algorithm, a widely used pathfinding and graph traversal technique. We will implement A* in Python, evaluate its performance, and explore how it is applied in real-world systems such as route optimization in Waze and Google Maps.

In this study, we assume that all the ways between the nodes are bidirectional: the graph is unoriented.
